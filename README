NAME
    Finglware - A new way to look at Perl 5

DESCRIPTION
    The best way to describe Finglware, is 'I want a different way of
    writing Perl 5, but not too different. I want all them boilerplate
    pragmas included in one module. I want 5.10 features imported by
    default. I'd like method modifiers, but I want them to be modular so I
    only load them when I need. I want a nicer, but minimal OOP framework to
    work with that's still flexible with automatic constructors and
    accessors. I want all of this, but I still want it to be fast. This
    module must also have a silly name.'. I think "Finglware" covers all of
    that. Especially the last requirement. Oh yeah, it has structs, too.

SYNOPSIS
  Using structs
        use Finglware;
    
        type::struct( 'People' => {
            name => 'String',
            age  => 'Int',
            opt  => 'HashRef',
        });
    
        my $person1 = People->new(
            name => 'Ted Winkleman',
            age => 35,
            opt => { 'cant_eat' => 'cheese' }
        );

        my $person2 = People->new(
            name => 'Kelly Kroolberg',
            age => "25"
        );

        say "Person 1 is called " . $person1->name;
        say "Person 2 got married and changed her surname";
        $person2->name('Kelly Simpson');
        say "Person 2 is called " . $person2->name;

  Inheritance
        # Base (Super) class
        package SchoolMember {
            use Finglware;
    
            # create attributes easily with "attr"
            # to give them values at start up, you can do so in __init
            # which is called after the constructor
            attr (
                'name',
                'age'
            );
    
            method __init($name, $age) {
                # you can set multiple attributes with "attr_set"
                $self->attr_set(
                    name => $name,
                    age  => $age,
                );
                say "New Member Started [$self]: " . $self->name;
            }
    
            method tell {
                say "Name: " . $self->name . ", Age: " . $self->age;
            }
        }
    
        package Teacher {
            use Finglware;
            extends 'SchoolMember';
    
            attr ( 'salary' );
    
            method __init($name, $age, $salary) {
                $self->salary($salary);
                $self->SUPER::__init(@_);
            }
    
            method tell {
                $self->SUPER::tell();
                say "Salary: " . $self->salary;
            }
        }

        package Student {   
            use Finglware;
            extends 'SchoolMember';
        
            attr ( 'marks' );
        
            method __init($name, $age, $marks) {
                $self->marks($marks);
                $self->SUPER::__init(@_);
            }

            method tell {
                $self->SUPER::tell();
                fmt::Println("Marks: " . $self->marks);
            }
        }

        my $teacher = Teacher->new('Mr. Somers', 45, 35000);
        my $student = Student->new('Nancy Wilson', 19, 75);
        my @members = ($teacher, $student);
    
        for my $member (@members) {
            $member->tell();
        }

METHODS
    Finglware supports method modifiers similar to Moose, with the same
    syntax. Modifiers available are: "after", "before", "around" and
    "override".

  Example modifier
        use Finglware with => 'hooks';
        func foo { say "Hi there" }
    
        override 'foo' => func {
            say "Hello, foo!"
        };

        # foo() now displays "Hello, foo!"

  attr
    Defines an attribute for the current class. The attribute can then be
    set and retrieved by the instance

        package MyClass {
            use Finglware;
            attr 'name';
        
            method __init {
                my $name = shift;
                $self->name( $name );
            }
        }

        my $class = MyClass->new('Sam');
        say $class->name; # Sam
        say $class->name('Barry'); # Barry

  attr_set
    Sets multiple attributes in one go.

        $self->attr_set(
            name => 'foo',
            bar  => 'baz',
            lang => 'perl
        );

        # or.. 

        method __init {
            my (%args) = @_;
            $self->attr_set(%args);
        }
